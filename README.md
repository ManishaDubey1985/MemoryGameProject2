## Technologies Used
-	HTML5
      -	The project uses HTML5 to create the basic elements and content of my website.
-	CSS3
      -	The project uses CSS3 to add custom styles to the elements and content of my website.
-	Bootstrap v4.3
      -	The project uses Bootstrap v4.3 to add a responsive grid system, prebuilt components, plugins built on jQuery, and Bootstrap styles to my website, before adding my custom styles.
-	JavaScript
      -	The project uses JavaScript from Bootstrap which is required to add functionality to some of Bootstrap's components. The project also has two inbuilt (created by me) javascript pages for the game and quiz pages respectively to manage the programming logic.
-	Git
      -	I've used Git as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in Cloud9, before pushing them to GitHub.
-	GitHub
      -	I've used GitHub as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website in a live environment.

### Testing
-	Tested all the pages on different devices and functions and display working fine.
## HTML Pages Validation
-   HTML pages validated ussing  - https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
      - On quiz page found "stray end tag <head> error" and fixed it by enclosing it before the start of body tag.
      - The two w3 validator errors unsolved are (common error on all the HTML pages):
           - The aria-labelledby attribute must point to an element in the same document.
           - attribute 0 is not serializable as xml 1.0.
      - On index page error found "Duplicate ID subcontainer"
## Deployment

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

1.	Created the repository on the GitHub named: MemoryGameProject2
2.	Initialised Git using the `git init` command.
3.	Cloned repository using `git clone` MemoryGameProject2
4.	Created working branch using `git checkout -b` command
5.	Created files in the working directory.
6.	Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the `git add .` command.
7.	Committed the files to Git using the `git commit -m` with various messages as the files are modified
8.	Pushed the code to working branch using git push origin working
9.	Created Git pages using the working branch
10.	Went into 'Settings' on my repository page in GitHub.
11.	Ran several regular commits throughout my project.
12. The project is awaited for UAT clearance under the working branch.
13. Once done, it will be pushed to the main branch for final launch of webesite.
